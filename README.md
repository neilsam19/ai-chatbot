# ai-chatbot

An intelligent AI chatbot using neural networks and natural language processing in Python.

## Usage

Run chatbot.py and keep entering queries.

## Improvements

Needs to have more training data and intents. Model training parameters can be experiemented with as well.

Another future plan is to integrate this chatbot in a Streamlit-like application.

Feel free to add or modify the intents in intents.json as well as the parameters to train the model in training.py.
